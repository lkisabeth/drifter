/**

 * returns the message (`HYPMessage`) that was created for wrapping the data. That
 * data structure is helpful for tracking the progress of messages as they are being
 * sent over the network. The message or the data are not strongly kept by the
 * framework. The data is copied and kept while it's queued, but the memory is
 * released as its fragments are sent. If the data is needed for later use, it
 * should be kept at this point, or otherwise it won't be recoverable. Messages
 * contain an identifier which can later be used to match events with the original
 * data. Progress notifications are issued to message observers, `HYPMessageObserver`.
 * When listening to progress tracking notifications, two concepts are important
 * to distinguish: sending and delivering. A message being sent is indicated by
 * `-hype:didSendMessage:toInstance:progress:complete:`, and means that the data
 * was buffered, but has not necessarily arrived to its destination. Delivery of
 * the message is indicated by `-hype:didDeliverMessage:toInstance:progress:complete:`
 * on the other hand, which in turn means that the content has reached its destination
 * and that has been acknowledged by the receiving instance. This distinction is
 * especially important in mesh, when the proxy device may not be the same as the
 * one the data is intended to. The `trackProgress` argument indicates whether to
 * track delivery. The data being queued to the output stream (sent) is always
 * notified, regardless of that setting. Notice that passing `YES` to this parameter
 * incurs extra overhead on the network, as it implies acknowledgements from the
 * destination back to the origin. If progress tracking is not needed, this should
 * always be set to `NO`. In case an error occurs that prevents the message from
 * reaching the destination, the delegate gets a failure notification through
 * `-hype:didFailSendingMessage:toInstance:error:` with an appropriate error message
 * describing the reasons. If a proper reason cannot be determined, a probable one
 * is used instead.
